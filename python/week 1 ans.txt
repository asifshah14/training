2) Intended audience - general public


1) Wrongly plotted unemployment rate.(8.6% is plotted above 8.8%)

2) Using graphic forms in inappropriate ways(distorting the data)

3 % rate has been plotted to deceive people into thinking that unemployment rate increased and then more or less remained same even though in actual reality it came down to 8.6% in November (graph should have had downward trend).
